            <p1 id="align">I like math because it makes me look smart. My dream in math is to become a professinal math dude.I also want to win a math championship.Here is why math is very important.Mathematics provides an effective way of building mental discipline and encourages logical reasoning and mental rigor. In addition, mathematical knowledge plays a crucial role in understanding the contents of other school subjects such as science, social studies, and even music and art. What do you use math for?  Why do you need math?  Imagine a world without math.. .How would you survive without math?  Could you?  We think the answer is no.  Look at all the wonderful things math is used for an why math is important.  Seriously, try one day without math and see if you catch yourself using it anyway.  Math is a natural way to organize and to think.  For example, when you're using the microwave, aren't you deciding how long to set the timer?  TIME?  Did you say TIME?  Can you tell someone when to meet you if you couldn't tell time? How do you know when it's lunchtime?

                How about your child's locker?  These are often numbered.  Could you tell one locker from the next without an identifying number?  And then there's the matter of the combination. Yes.. some are letters but numbers are more common.
                
                How about cooking and baking?  You need to be able to measure ingredients and proportion ingredients if you need more or less servings.</p1>
